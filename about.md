# <co>Improved Paths</c>

Small mod that adds some improvements to the <cy>Paths of Power</c>, such as:

- Counter of the orbs you currently have
- Arrow pointing to the currently active path
- How many orbs you need to buy the remaining paths

This won't do much if the player has completed all of them prior to making this mod. The code will be subject to change in the future.
