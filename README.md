# Improved Paths (Geode mods)

Pretty small mod for Geode that just adds some extra additions to the Paths of Power in Geometry Dash. Yes, it's useless when the player has completed all of them prior to installing this mod. The code behind this will change the moment Node IDs for the Path's layer is provided.
