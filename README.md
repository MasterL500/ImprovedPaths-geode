# Improved Paths (Geode mods)

Another small geode-exclusive mod for Geometry Dash. Adds some additional info and details to the Paths of Power, such as:

- Counter of the orbs you currently have
- Arrow pointing to the currently active path
- How many orbs you need to buy the remaining paths

It won't serve much of a purpose if the Player has completed all the paths prior to installing the mod.

## Contact

Pretty small mod that I won't be currently active developing it, the code is subject to change if Node IDs for the GJPathsLayer are added. To report bugs, crashes or issues with other mods, you can contact me through [Geode's Discord](https://discord.gg/9e43WMKzhp), [My Discord server](https://discord.gg/tFUyJw5) or creating a GitHub Issue.

## Special Thanks
